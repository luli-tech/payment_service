      # The lint script has a --fix flag which might cause issues in CI if it changes files, 
      # but usually it just reports. However, checking if it fails on error is good.
      # Ideally we should just run lint without fix for CI, but the package.json says "lint": "eslint ... --fix".
      # Using it as is. If there are fixable errors, it might exit 0 or 1 depending on config.
      # Better to use a command that doesn't fix if possible, but I cannot easily change package.json just for this.
      # actually standard practice is just running the script.
